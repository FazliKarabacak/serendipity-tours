## Itinerary

### Day 1: Istanbul (World Heritage Site)

See the ancient Hippodrome where chariot races once entertained 100,000 spectators during Byzantine times.

Rustem Pasha Mosque boasts the most exquisite collection of Iznik tiles in Istanbul, a masterpiece of 16th-century Ottoman architecture. The Gallipoli Peninsula was the site of a devastating WWI campaign where over 100,000 soldiers perished in 1915, now a solemn place of pilgrimage particularly for visitors from Australia and New Zealand.

Discover the legendary city of Troy, see the replica of the Trojan horse, and explore the ancient hospital complex of Asklepion in Pergamon.

*Troy was immortalized in Homer's Iliad and was considered mythical until its discovery in 1870 by Heinrich Schliemann. The archaeological site contains nine distinct layers of settlements spanning 4,000 years from 3000 BC to 500 AD. The wooden Trojan Horse replica commemorates the famous Greek stratagem that ended the Trojan War. Pergamon was one of the ancient world's most important cultural centers, featuring a 200,000-volume library rivaled only by Alexandria. The Asklepion was an ancient medical center where the famous physician Galen practiced innovative treatments including music therapy, mud baths, and dream interpretation—essentially the world's first health spa.*

### Day 5: Ephesus (World Heritage Site) - Kusadasi
Visit the House of Virgin Mary, the incredible ancient city of Ephesus with its colossal Greek Theatre, the Marble Road, the Celsus Library, the Temple of Diana, and the Basilica of St. John.

*The House of Virgin Mary is believed to be where Mary spent her final years, based on visions of 19th-century German nun Anne Catherine Emmerich and now recognized as a pilgrimage site by the Catholic Church. Ephesus was once the second-largest city in the Roman Empire with a population of 250,000. Its remarkably preserved ruins include the magnificent Library of Celsus with its impressive two-story facade, the Great Theatre that could seat 25,000 spectators, and the marble-paved Sacred Way once walked by Cleopatra and Mark Antony.

*Aphrodisias was a center for sculpture during the Roman period, with a remarkable stadium that could seat 30,000 spectators—one of the best preserved in the ancient world. The temple of Aphrodite and the sculptor's workshop have yielded thousands of intricate marble statues now displayed in the on-site museum. Laodicea was a wealthy banking center and one of the Seven Churches addressed in the Book of Revelation. Pamukkale, meaning "Cotton Castle" in Turkish, features a stunning cascade of white calcium-rich terraces formed over millennia by mineral-laden hot springs. Ancient Hierapolis was built as a thermal spa city by the Pergamon kings in 190 BC, with an exceptionally preserved necropolis containing more than 1,200 tombs and a large Roman theater with seating for 12,000 people.*

*Perge was one of the most prosperous cities of ancient Pamphylia, with impressive colonnaded streets, a massive stadium, elegant baths, and a nymphaeum (monumental fountain). The site has yielded extraordinary sculptures now housed in the Antalya Museum. Aspendos boasts the best-preserved ancient theater in the Mediterranean, built in 155 AD during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and still used for performances today due to its remarkable acoustics—a whisper from the stage can be heard in the top row. The Antalya Museum houses one of Turkey's richest archaeological collections, including artifacts spanning 2,500 years.

*Catalhoyuk is one of the world's oldest towns and best-preserved Neolithic settlements, predating pottery and agriculture in some regions. This 9,000-year-old UNESCO World Heritage site provides unprecedented insights into early human communities, with densely packed mud-brick houses entered through roof hatches rather than doors. Excavations have revealed sophisticated wall paintings, sculptures, and evidence of complex religious practices, revolutionizing our understanding of early human society. Konya was the home of the 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi mystic Rumi (Mevlana), founder of the Mevlevi Order known for their Whirling Dervish ceremony. The Mevlana Museum, housed in the former dervish lodge, contains Rumi's tomb and personal artifacts.

*The Ihlara Valley is a 16 km long canyon carved by the Melendiz River, with walls rising 150 meters high and dotted with over 100 rock-cut Byzantine churches decorated with colorful frescoes. Selime Monastery is the largest religious structure in Cappadocia, carved entirely from the soft volcanic tuff. Kaymakli is one of 36 underground cities in Cappadocia, featuring eight levels below ground that could shelter up to 5,000 people during times of danger. These subterranean complexes were built by early Christians to hide from religious persecution, with ingenious ventilation systems, water wells, communal kitchens, and rolling stone doors. Uchisar and Ortahisar feature natural rock formations that have been hollowed out and fortified to create "rock castles" offering panoramic views of the surrounding valleys.*

**Distance**: 240 km  
**Meals**: Breakfast, dinner  
**Accommodation**: Cave Hotel in Cappadocia

Optional hot air balloon ride over Cappadocia early in the morning. Discover Cappadocia's unique landscape, visit Magic Valley, Zelve Open Air Museum, Monk's Valley, and Goreme Open Air Museum. Enjoy local cuisine and visit potter's workshops in Avanos.

*Cappadocia's extraordinary landscape was formed when ancient volcanic eruptions blanketed the region in thick ash, which solidified into soft rock called "tuff." Wind and water erosion sculpted this terrain into the fantastical "fairy chimneys" and unique formations seen today. The Goreme Open Air Museum contains over 30 rock-cut Byzantine churches and chapels from the 10th-12th centuries, many decorated with vibrant frescoes depicting scenes from the Bible. Pasabag (Monks Valley) features remarkable mushroom-shaped rock pinnacles where monks once lived in seclusion. The Zelve Open Air Museum was a monastic valley settlement continuously inhabited from the 9th to 20th centuries. Avanos has been a center for pottery making since Hittite times, using distinctive red clay from the Kizilirmak River—Turkey's longest river.*
