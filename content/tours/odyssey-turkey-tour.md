The archaeological site contains nine distinct layers of settlements spanning 4,000 years from 3000 BC to 500 AD. The wooden Trojan Horse replica commemorates the famous Greek stratagem that ended the Trojan War. Pergamon was one of the ancient world's most important cultural centers, featuring a 200,000-volume library rivaled only by Alexandria. The Asklepion was an ancient medical center where the famous physician Galen practiced innovative treatments including music therapy, mud baths, and dream interpretation—essentially the world's first health spa.*

Visit the House of Virgin Mary, the incredible ancient city of Ephesus with its colossal Greek Theatre, the Marble Road, the Celsus Library, the Temple of Diana, and the basilica and tomb of St. John.

*The House of Virgin Mary is believed to be where Mary spent her final years, based on visions of 19th-century German nun Anne Catherine Emmerich and now recognized as a pilgrimage site by the Catholic Church. Ephesus was once the second-largest city in the Roman Empire with a population of 250,000. Its remarkably preserved ruins include the magnificent Library of Celsus with its impressive two-story facade, the Great Theatre that could seat 25,000 spectators, and the marble-paved Sacred Way once walked by Cleopatra and Mark Antony.

Continue to Miletus, the famous Ionian city visited by St. Paul during his missionary journey. End the day at Didyma with its well-preserved Apollo Temple.

*Priene is considered the world's first city built on a grid system, designed by the architect Hippodamus in the 4th century BC. Its dramatic setting on a cliff overlooking the Meander River Valley offers spectacular views. The Temple of Athena was dedicated by Alexander the Great himself. Miletus was once one of the greatest seafaring cities of the ancient world, the birthplace of philosophers Thales and Anaximander, and where St. Paul bade farewell to the Ephesian elders (Acts 20). Didyma houses the Temple of Apollo, one of the largest and best-preserved temples of the ancient world, which once housed an oracle second only to Delphi in importance. The colossal columns standing today represent some of the finest examples of Ionic architecture.*

### Day 8: Bodrum (Halicarnassus)

*Bodrum Castle was built by the Knights of St. John in the 15th century partly using stones from the Mausoleum. Today it houses one of the world's finest museums of underwater archaeology, featuring artifacts from shipwrecks dating back to the Bronze Age, including the famous Uluburun shipwreck (14th century BC). The Mausoleum of Mausolus was built between 353-350 BC for Carian King Mausolus by his sister-wife Artemisia, and was so magnificent that it became one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and gave us the word "mausoleum." Though destroyed by earthquakes, its foundation and some sculptural elements remain, while others are displayed in the British Museum.*

*Kaunos was an important ancient Carian city with a fascinating blend of Carian, Greek, and Roman influences. Its rock-cut tombs carved into the cliff face are spectacular examples of ancient funerary architecture. The Dalyan Delta is one of Turkey's most important conservation areas, home to the endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). Xanthos was the capital of ancient Lycia and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The ancient city revealed remarkable tomb monuments including the Nereid Monument and the Harpy Tomb (now in the British Museum). Patara features Turkey's longest beach (18 km) and was the birthplace of St. Nicholas (Santa Claus).

*Myra features some of the most impressive Lycian rock-cut tombs in Anatolia, carved into the cliff face and resembling house facades. The large Roman theater is remarkably well-preserved. The Church of St. Nicholas was built over the tomb of St. Nicholas (Santa Claus), who was the bishop of Myra in the 4th century AD. Kekova Island shelters the partially sunken ruins of an ancient city, submerged by earthquakes in the 2nd century AD. Portions of houses and stairs descending into the water can be seen from boats.

*Perge was one of the most prosperous cities of ancient Pamphylia, with impressive colonnaded streets, a massive stadium, elegant baths, and a nymphaeum (monumental fountain). The site has yielded extraordinary sculptures now housed in the Antalya Museum. Aspendos boasts the best-preserved ancient theater in the Mediterranean, built in 155 AD during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and still used for performances today due to its remarkable acoustics—a whisper from the stage can be heard in the top row. The Antalya Museum houses one of Turkey's richest archaeological collections, including artifacts spanning 2,500 years.

*Aphrodisias was a center for sculpture during the Roman period, with a remarkable stadium that could seat 30,000 spectators—one of the best preserved in the ancient world. The temple of Aphrodite and the sculptor's workshop have yielded thousands of intricate marble statues now displayed in the on-site museum. Laodicea was a wealthy banking center and one of the Seven Churches addressed in the Book of Revelation. Pamukkale, meaning "Cotton Castle" in Turkish, features a stunning cascade of white calcium-rich terraces formed over millennia by mineral-laden hot springs. Ancient Hierapolis was built as a thermal spa city by the Pergamon kings in 190 BC, with an exceptionally preserved necropolis containing more than 1,200 tombs and a large Roman theater with seating for 12,000 people.*

*Catalhoyuk is one of the world's oldest towns and best-preserved Neolithic settlements, predating pottery and agriculture in some regions. This 9,000-year-old UNESCO World Heritage site provides unprecedented insights into early human communities, with densely packed mud-brick houses entered through roof hatches rather than doors. Excavations have revealed sophisticated wall paintings, sculptures, and evidence of complex religious practices, revolutionizing our understanding of early human society. Konya was the home of the 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi mystic Rumi (Mevlana), founder of the Mevlevi Order known for their Whirling Dervish ceremony. The Mevlana Museum, housed in the former dervish lodge, contains Rumi's tomb and personal artifacts.

*The Ihlara Valley is a 16 km long canyon carved by the Melendiz River, with walls rising 150 meters high and dotted with over 100 rock-cut Byzantine churches decorated with colorful frescoes. Selime Monastery is the largest religious structure in Cappadocia, carved entirely from the soft volcanic tuff. Derinkuyu and Kaymakli are two of 36 underground cities in Cappadocia, featuring eight levels below ground that could shelter up to 5,000 people during times of danger. These subterranean complexes were built by early Christians to hide from religious persecution, with ingenious ventilation systems, water wells, communal kitchens, and rolling stone doors. Uchisar Castle is the highest point in Cappadocia, offering panoramic views of the surrounding fairy chimneys and valleys. Pigeon Valley gets its name from the thousands of pigeon houses carved into the soft tufa, as pigeons were once used for communication, fertilizer, and food.*

**Distance**: 280 km  
**Meals**: Breakfast, lunch, dinner  
**Accommodation**: Cave Hotel in Cappadocia

### Day 15: Cappadocia (World Heritage Site)
Optional hot air balloon ride over Cappadocia early in the morning. Discover Cappadocia's unique landscape of volcanic rock formations and cave dwellings. Visit Magic Valley, Zelve Open Air Museum, Monk's Valley, and Goreme Open Air Museum. Enjoy local cuisine in Avanos, known for its pottery tradition, and visit local craft workshops.

*Cappadocia's extraordinary landscape was formed when ancient volcanic eruptions blanketed the region in thick ash, which solidified into soft rock called "tuff." Wind and water erosion sculpted this terrain into the fantastical "fairy chimneys" and unique formations seen today. The Goreme Open Air Museum contains over 30 rock-cut Byzantine churches and chapels from the 10th-12th centuries, many decorated with vibrant frescoes depicting scenes from the Bible. Pasabag (Monks Valley) features remarkable mushroom-shaped rock pinnacles where monks once lived in seclusion. The Zelve Open Air Museum was a monastic valley settlement continuously inhabited from the 9th to 20th centuries. Avanos has been a center for pottery making since Hittite times, using distinctive red clay from the Kizilirmak River—Turkey's longest river.*
