Pergamon was one of the ancient world's most important cultural centers, known for its 200,000-volume library (second only to Alexandria).

*Catalhoyuk is one of the world's oldest towns and best-preserved Neolithic settlements, predating pottery and even agriculture in some areas. This 9,000-year-old site provides unprecedented insights into early human communities with its densely packed mud-brick houses entered through roof hatches rather than doors. Excavations have revealed sophisticated wall paintings, sculptures, and evidence of complex religious practices, revolutionizing our understanding of early human society. Konya was the home of the 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi mystic Rumi (Mevlana), founder of the Mevlevi Order known for their Whirling Dervish ceremony.

Kaymakli is one of 36 underground cities in Cappadocia, featuring eight levels below ground that could shelter up to 5,000 people and their livestock during times of danger. The underground cities were built by early Christians to hide from religious persecution. Uchisar and Ortahisar feature natural rock formations that have been hollowed out and fortified to create "rock castles" offering panoramic views of the surrounding valleys.

*Cappadocia's extraordinary landscape was formed when ancient volcanic eruptions blanketed the region in thick ash, which solidified into soft rock called "tuff." Wind and water erosion sculpted this terrain into the fantastical "fairy chimneys" and unique formations seen today. The Goreme Open Air Museum contains over 30 rock-cut Byzantine churches and chapels from the 10th-12th centuries, many decorated with vibrant frescoes. Pasabag (Monks Valley) features remarkable mushroom-shaped rock pinnacles. The Zelve Open Air Museum was a monastic valley settlement continuously inhabited from the 9th to 20th centuries.

*Gaziantep (ancient Antiochia ad Taurum) has been continuously inhabited since 3650 BC. The remarkable Zeugma Mosaic Museum houses spectacular Roman mosaics rescued from the ancient city of Zeugma before it was flooded by dam construction, including the haunting "Gypsy Girl" mosaic that has become an icon of Turkish heritage. The city's bazaar has been trading continuously since the Ottoman era, offering copper goods, spices, traditional foods, and the region's famous pistachio baklava.

### Day 11: Mount Nemrut (World Heritage Site) - Adiyaman
Explore Mount Nemrut, the best preserved Roman bridge of Cendere, the open air sanctuary in Arsemia, and the mausoleum of King Antiochus.

*Mount Nemrut is home to one of the most ambitious construction projects of the ancient world. At the 2,134-meter summit stands the 1st century BC funerary sanctuary of King Antiochus I of Commagene, featuring colossal statues of gods and the king himself, some reaching 9 meters tall. The massive heads now rest eerily on the mountainside after earthquakes toppled them from their bodies. The Cendere Bridge was built by the Roman Legion XVI in 200 AD during Emperor Septimius Severus' reign and has been in continuous use for over 1,800 years. Arsameia was the summer capital of the Commagene Kingdom with rock reliefs showing King Antiochus shaking hands with Hercules.*

Visit Göbeklitepe, the oldest temple of the world, and Karahan Tepe. Explore Harran with its beehive houses where the Prophet Abraham lived, the Halepli Bahce Mosaic Museum, Urfa Archaeology Museum, and Balikli Gol with its Roman fortress.

*Göbeklitepe has revolutionized our understanding of human history since its discovery in 1994. Dating to 9600-8200 BC, it's the world's oldest known temple complex, built 7,000 years before Stonehenge and 6,000 years before writing was invented. The site features massive T-shaped pillars carved with animal reliefs, proving that organized religion and monumental architecture existed before the development of agriculture. Nearby Karahan Tepe is a similar site currently being excavated. Harran, mentioned in the Book of Genesis, features distinctive beehive-shaped mud houses, a technique used for at least 3,000 years.
