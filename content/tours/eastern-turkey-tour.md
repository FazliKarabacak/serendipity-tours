*Safranbolu is an outstanding example of a traditional Ottoman trading town that once served as an important caravan station on the main East-West trade route.

This region receives the highest rainfall in Turkey, creating a verdant landscape completely different from the country's more arid regions. The road to Trabzon passes through numerous picturesque fishing villages and vast tea and hazelnut plantations that cling to the steep hillsides. Trabzon itself was founded as a Greek colony named Trapezus in the 8th century BC and later became the capital of the Empire of Trebizond (1204-1461), the last outpost of Byzantine civilization that survived almost a decade after Constantinople fell to the Ottomans.*

The complex includes rock churches, chapels, kitchens, and living quarters, with remarkable frescoes dating from the 9th to 19th centuries. According to legend, two priests discovered a miraculous icon of the Virgin Mary in a cave on the mountain that had been painted by St. Luke. The Church of Hagia Sophia (13th century) features exceptional frescoes depicting scenes from the life of Christ and portraits of the imperial family of Trebizond. The city's historical center preserves its medieval street plan with its citadel, ancient city walls, and characteristic timber-framed houses with balconies.

The Cifte Minare Madrasa, built in 1253, features an elaborately decorated portal and twin minarets with intricate brickwork. The Yakutiye Madrasa, built in 1310, showcases exceptional stone carving and a unique turquoise-tiled minaret.

*Ani was once the majestic capital of the medieval Armenian Kingdom, known as "the city of 1,001 churches" and home to over 100,000 people before being abandoned after Mongol invasions. Now a UNESCO World Heritage site, its stunning churches showcase the height of Armenian architectural achievement, with magnificent stone masonry and innovative engineering. The Church of the Holy Redeemer, the Cathedral of Ani, and the Church of St. Gregory feature remarkable architectural elements including pointed arches that predate Gothic architecture in Europe. Set on a triangular plateau cut by deep ravines, the location marks the modern border between Turkey and Armenia, with the Akhurian River serving as the frontier. Kars Castle was built in the 12th century by the Armenian Bagratid Dynasty and later expanded by the Ottomans. The Church of the Twelve Apostles is a 10th-century Armenian church later converted into a mosque, featuring distinctive cylindrical architecture.

Built in the 18th century by a semi-independent Kurdish ruler, this palace-complex includes a mosque, harem quarters, and one of the first examples of central heating in any Turkish building. Mount Ararat is Turkey's highest peak and is steeped in biblical tradition as the supposed resting place of Noah's Ark after the Great Flood. The region around Dogu Beyazit has been a crossroads of civilizations for thousands of years, with ancient trade routes connecting Anatolia, the Caucasus, and Persia. Van Castle contains the tomb of King Argishti I with a trilingual inscription that helped scholars decipher the Urartian language. The castle site also includes remains of an ancient harbor, as the waters of Lake Van once reached the foot of the fortress.

The detailed reliefs showing scenes from the Old Testament are considered masterpieces of medieval Christian art. Lake Van is the largest lake in Turkey and one of the largest soda lakes in the world, with highly alkaline waters that give it a distinctive turquoise color. Midyat is known as the "City of Stone Masters" with exquisite limestone architecture dating back to the 5th century. It remains an important center for Syriac Christianity with numerous active churches and monasteries, including Mor Gabriel Monastery, which has functioned continuously since 397 AD.

*The 5th-century Dayrul Zafran (Saffron) Monastery has been an important spiritual center for Syrian Orthodox Christians for over 1,500 years and continues to function today. Mardin is famous for its stunning Artuqid architecture characterized by elaborately carved limestone buildings that cascade down a hill overlooking the Mesopotamian plains. The 12th-century Great Mosque features a distinctive minaret that dominates the skyline. The city's bazaar preserves traditional artisanship, including silversmiths, coppersmiths, and soap-makers.

*Göbeklitepe has revolutionized our understanding of human history since its discovery in 1994. Dating to 9600-8200 BC, it's the world's oldest known temple complex, built 7,000 years before Stonehenge and 6,000 years before writing was invented. The site features massive T-shaped pillars carved with animal reliefs, proving that organized religion and monumental architecture existed before the development of agriculture. Nearby Karahan Tepe is a similar site currently being excavated. Harran, mentioned in the Book of Genesis, features distinctive beehive-shaped mud houses, a technique used for at least 3,000 years. Urfa (ancient Edessa) is associated with the prophet Abraham and features sacred pools filled with carp that Muslims consider holy—legend says the pools formed when King Nimrod threw Abraham into a fire, which God turned into water. The fish are believed to be sacred, and feeding them is considered a blessing.*

Journey to Mount Nemrut to see the colossal statues and tomb of King Antiochus I. Visit the best-preserved Roman bridge of Cendere and the open-air sanctuary in Arsemia.

*Mount Nemrut is home to one of the most ambitious construction projects of the ancient world. At the 2,134-meter summit stands the 1st century BC funerary sanctuary of King Antiochus I of Commagene, featuring colossal statues of gods and the king himself, some reaching 9 meters tall. The massive heads now rest eerily on the mountainside after earthquakes toppled them from their bodies. The king created a unique religion combining Greek, Persian, and Armenian deities, reflecting the mixed cultural heritage of his Commagene Kingdom. The Cendere Bridge was built by the Roman Legion XVI in 200 AD during Emperor Septimius Severus' reign and has been in continuous use for over 1,800 years. Arsameia was the summer capital of the Commagene Kingdom with rock reliefs showing King Antiochus shaking hands with Hercules—the earliest known depiction of a handshake in art history.*

The remarkable Zeugma Mosaic Museum houses spectacular Roman mosaics rescued from the ancient city of Zeugma before it was flooded by dam construction, including the haunting "Gypsy Girl" mosaic that has become an icon of Turkish heritage. The city's bazaar has been trading continuously since the Ottoman era, offering copper goods, spices, traditional foods, and the region's famous pistachio baklava. The Roman castle dates to the 2nd-3rd century AD and was expanded by the Byzantines. Gaziantep is recognized by UNESCO as a "Creative City of Gastronomy" with one of the world's most sophisticated culinary traditions featuring over 400 distinct dishes.
